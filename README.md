I made a cool website that tells funny jokes in Hindi! I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it, and it gets its jokes from an API key. So, whenever someone visits the site, they can click a button and get a random joke to laugh at. It's a fun project that shows off my web development skills and creativity, and it's perfect for anyone who wants a good laugh in Hindi.
